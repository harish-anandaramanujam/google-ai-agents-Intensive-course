This is a crucial, foundational step in drug discovery, and AI is making significant inroads here.\n\nLet's break down what this means and how AI is being applied:\n\n**What is Target Identification and Validation?**\n\nBefore you can develop a drug, you need to know *what* to target. A \"drug target\" is typically a specific molecule within the body (often a protein, but can also be a gene, RNA, or even a pathway) that is involved in a disease process.\n\n*   **Identification:** This is the process of finding potential targets. It involves understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of a disease and pinpointing molecules that play a critical role.\n*   **Validation:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated. This means confirming that modulating this target (e.g., by inhibiting or activating it) will actually have a beneficial effect on the disease and is safe.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI's power lies in its ability to process and find patterns in massive, complex datasets that are far beyond human capacity to analyze manually. Here's how it's being applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data (Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Metabolomics):**\n    *   **What it is:** These fields generate vast amounts of data about an organism's genes (genomics), proteins (proteomics), RNA (transcriptomics), and metabolites (metabolomics).\n    *   **AI's Role:**\n        *   **Pattern Recognition:** AI algorithms can sift through this data to identify genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways that are abnormally expressed or mutated in diseased cells or tissues compared to healthy ones.\n        *   **Biomarker Discovery:** Identifying these changes can lead to the discovery of biomarkers for early diagnosis or for predicting disease progression.\n        *   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Advanced AI can help distinguish between changes that are merely correlated with a disease and those that are actually driving the disease process (i.e., potential targets).\n    *   **Example:** An AI might analyze genomic data from thousands of cancer patients and identify a specific gene mutation that is consistently present in aggressive tumors. This mutated gene product (protein) then becomes a strong candidate for a drug target.\n\n2.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n    *   **What it is:** Biological systems are not simple linear chains of events. They are complex networks of interacting molecules and pathways.\n    *   **AI's Role:**\n        *   **Mapping Interactions:** AI can build sophisticated models of these biological networks, showing how different molecules interact with each other.\n        *   **Identifying Critical Nodes:** By analyzing these networks, AI can identify \"central\" or \"bottleneck\" molecules or pathways that, if disrupted, could have a significant impact on the disease state. These are prime targets.\n        *   **Understanding Systemic Effects:** AI can predict how modulating a specific target might affect other parts of the biological network, helping to anticipate potential side effects or off-target activities.\n    *   **Example:** In a metabolic disease, AI could map out all the related metabolic pathways and identify a key enzyme that, if inhibited, would correct an imbalance causing the disease.\n\n3.  **Integrating Diverse Data Sources:**\n    *   **Beyond \"Omics\":** AI can integrate data from various sources, including scientific literature, electronic health records (EHRs), clinical trial results, and even patient-reported outcomes.\n    *   **AI's Role:**\n        *   **Knowledge Graphs:** AI can build knowledge graphs that link entities (genes, diseases, drugs, symptoms) and their relationships, uncovering hidden connections.\n        *   **Hypothesis Generation:** By analyzing the collective body of scientific knowledge and patient data, AI can generate novel hypotheses about disease mechanisms and potential targets that human researchers might miss.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might read millions of research papers and identify a common thread linking a specific protein deficiency, a particular symptom cluster in EHRs, and a successful experimental therapy in a rare disease, suggesting a novel target.\n\n4.  **\"Undruggable\" Target Exploration:**\n    *   **What it is:** Many disease-driving proteins have historically been considered \"undruggable\" because they lack well-defined binding pockets or are difficult to target with traditional small molecules or antibodies.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of these proteins and identifying novel ways to interact with them, perhaps through allosteric sites (sites other than the active site) or by targeting protein-protein interactions.\n\n**Why This Development is So Important:**\n\n*   **Reduces Guesswork:** Traditionally, target identification was often based on existing knowledge and some educated guesswork. AI brings a more data-driven and systematic approach.\n*   **Expedites the Process:** Identifying and validating a target can take years. AI significantly speeds up this initial, crucial phase.\n*   **Uncovers Novelty:** AI can find targets that are not obvious from current biological understanding, leading to truly novel therapeutic strategies.\n*   **Foundation for Drug Design:** A well-identified and validated target is the bedrock upon which successful drug discovery and development are built.\n\nIn essence, AI is acting as a powerful microscope and a super-intelligent analyst, allowing researchers to see and understand biological systems with unprecedented clarity, thereby identifying the most promising points of intervention for treating diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of using AI for **Target Identification and Validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
