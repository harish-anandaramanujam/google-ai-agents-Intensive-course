Take the short, paved trail to the base of the lower falls for stunning views.\n*   **Afternoon:** Explore the iconic sights of El Capitan and Half Dome. Consider a leisurely walk or bike ride on the Valley Loop Trail for different perspectives of these granite giants.\n*   **Evening:** Enjoy a picnic dinner with views of Yosemite Falls as the sun sets.\n\n**Day 2: Mist Trail and High Country Views**\n\n*   **Morning:** Embark on the famous Mist Trail hike. This challenging but rewarding trail takes you past Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall, offering breathtaking close-up encounters with powerful waterfalls. **(Note: This is a strenuous hike, so start early and be prepared with water and appropriate gear.)**\n*   **Afternoon:** After descending the Mist Trail, drive up to Glacier Point for panoramic views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and the High Sierra. This is an excellent spot for photography.\n*   **Evening:** Relax and enjoy dinner at one of the lodges in Yosemite Valley.\n\n**Day 3: Mariposa Grove and Departure**\n\n*   **Morning:** Drive to the southern end of the park to visit the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. Wander among these ancient, colossal trees, including the Grizzly Giant and the California Tunnel Tree.\n*   **Afternoon:** Enjoy a final scenic drive through the park, perhaps stopping at Tunnel View for one last iconic vista of Yosemite Valley.\n*   **Evening:** Depart from Yosemite National Park.\n\nThis itinerary is a suggestion and can be customized based on your interests and fitness level. Remember to check the Yosemite National Park website for any alerts, closures, or reservation requirements before your visit.
